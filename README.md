# Welcome!

This is my first React project! The beginnings of this project was derived from the Meta Front-End Developer Coursera course. We were given a list of subjects and stories to pick out from and create a single web page based on the given story. I picked this story of a jewelry brand that wanted to enhance their web presence to attract more customers and present their jewelry in a new perspective. 

Initially, I created it with simple HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. Then, when I completed the HTML & CSS In Depth module and moved to React Basics, I decided to immediately put my learnings to use and recreate this project but using React!

This was an extremlely satisfying project, learning on the go helps to strengthen my resourcefullness and ability to read documentation. I was able to learn how to use React hooks and have some hands-on experience on useState! This project also deepened my understanding of React components and how to go about creating sections of a web-page. 

This project was also heavily influence by Brian Design on youtube. I followed through his tutorial on making a react website just so I can see how other people structure their code and see how it fits with my style. I also used some of his components and built off of it to include my own take on it. 

# Colors
I decided go with an earth tone color palette. I mostly took this idea due to the fact that jewels and such are formed in the ground, so I though an earthy tone to the project would flow nicely. Earth tones also exude harmony in my opinion and with jewelry, harmony is an important aspect when garnering attention and elegance to a jewelry product.
